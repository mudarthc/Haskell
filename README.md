## Citing

my calc library was created with references including:
```
Curtis' code 
```

### Extra Parts

1. derivatives 
3. trig funtions and other useful function eg.. Subtract, to the power of ...
2. integrals
3. surface area of revolution about y
4. surface area of revolution about x


# Challenges 
The main chalenges where implementing extra features into the Haskell math library. 

# How I overcame
I used extra features such as :

1. implemented the calculation of derivatives 
3. trig funtions and other useful function eg.. Subtract, to the power of ...
2. implemented integrals
3. surface area of revolution about y
4. surface area of revolution about x

# Utitity 
run on any terminal
